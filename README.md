# Nifty Shaders

Course project for the Game Engine Architecture course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University.

The engine is Unreal Engine 4.
The project contains two shaders written in hlsl and some UI to control their parameters.

The first one is a VHS shader. It makes the game look like it's displayed on an old TV. 
With the UI you can control how much the screen shifts on both the horizontal and vertical axis as well as how much the vignette pulses.

The second one is a Toon shader. It makes the game appear hand drawn.
With the UI you can control how thick the outline is, after what light intensity shading starts and how many layers of shadow there will be.

Here is a demo:
